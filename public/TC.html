<h2 id="terms-of-use">1. Terms of Use</h2>

<h3>1.1 About the Service</h3>
<p>
CornerstonePlus is an online tool that provides access to planning and
property-related information for selected local government areas in Queensland.
It is intended to assist users to understand planning and building constraints relevant
to a property. It does <strong>not</strong> replace formal advice from local councils,
certifiers or other professionals.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Who these terms apply to</h3>
<p>
These Terms of Use apply to all users of the Service, including property owners,
builders, designers, consultants, and members of the public who access the Service.

these Terms, you must not use the Service.
</p>

<h3>1.4 No legal, planning or building advice</h3>
<p>
The information provided through the Service is general in nature and is for
information purposes only. It does not constitute:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>legal or financial advice;</li>

  <li>building or engineering certification, approval or compliance advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You should obtain your own independent advice from qualified professionals and confirm
all information with the relevant local government or authority before making any
decision or taking any action based on the information displayed.
</p>

<h3>1.5 Accuracy and availability of information</h3>
<p>
We aim to provide accurate and up-to-date information, but we do not guarantee that
any information displayed through the Service is complete, current, error-free or
suitable for your particular purpose. Mapping layers and data may be sourced from
third parties (including local councils and government agencies) and may change
